# CS 260 Notes

[My startup - Giftly](https://justgiftly.com)

## AWS

My IP address is: 3.88.81.212
Launching my AMI I initially put it on a private subnet. First my domain name was not connecting with the server, it was showing correct and synced with the server, but the problem was in the name servers were not matching with dns and domain registrar's. But it worked eventually after matching name servers. 

## Caddy

I made my justgiftly https. 

# Assignment 1: Simon HTML Notes
Locating and managing the `.pem` file for SSH access.
Understanding how Route 53 DNS settings and subdomains connect to the server. Understood basic structure of html. ained experience deploying a static HTML application to an AWS server. 

## HTML

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.
