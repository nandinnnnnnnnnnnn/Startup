### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **CSS** -  Responsive styling and animations for buttons and modals to enhance user experience.
- **React** - Build reusable components for login forms, wish list items, and dashboards. Use React Router for navigation.
- **Service** -Provide backend endpoints for managing wish lists and user authentication.

- **DB/Login** - Store user accounts and wish lists, ensuring data security with encrypted credentials.
- **WebSocket** - Enable real-time notifications for shared wish list updates and display changes instantly.


###HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable, I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- [x] **HTML Pages** - Multiple HTML pages representing the core structure:
  - `index.html`: Home page with an introduction and login form.
  - `wishlist.html`: Contains the wish list and cart functionality.
    - `about.html`: What our website is about.

- [x] **Links** - The login page links to the wish list page. The wish list page contains links to manage, add, or remove items.

- [x] **Text** - Each section includes a clear textual description of the app‚Äôs functionality, including login, wish list management, and real-time updates.

- [x] **Images** - Application includes relevant image on about.html

- [x] **DB/Login** - A login input form with a username and password field. The wish list represents stored data that will later be managed.

- [x] **WebSocket** - A real-time updates section to show when a user modifies a wish list or purchases an item.
